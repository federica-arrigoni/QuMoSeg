# QuMoSeg

Federica Arrigoni, Willi Menapace, Marcel Seelbach Benkner, Elisa Ricci and Vladislav Golyanik. *Quantum Motion Segmentation*. ECCV 2022

This folder contains the code for the above paper. It is structured into three parts:

1) **QuMoSeg-MATLAB** This folder contains the Matlab code for generating synthetic datasets, creating QUBO and comparing to non-quantum state of the art. Examples of synthetic datasets can be found in the folder QuMoSeg_Data. For questions about this part, please contact Federica Arrigoni federica.arrigoni@polimi.it 
2) **QuMoSeg_Demo.py** This script contains the python code for running our quantum methods on D-Wave Advantage 4.1. For questions about this part, please contact Vladislav Golyanik golyanik@mpi-inf.mpg.de 
3) **datasets** This folder contains our new dataset, comprising 6 images with multiple planar objects. Original images, keypoints locations/descriptors, matches and ground-truth labels are available, together with the python code used to compute them. For questions about this part, please contact Willi Menapace willi.menapace@unitn.it
