Federica Arrigoni, Willi Menapace, Marcel Seelbach Benkner, Elisa Ricci and Vladislav Golyanik. *Quantum Motion Segmentation*. ECCV 2022

This folder contains the code for the above paper. It is structured into three parts:

1) **QuMoSeg-Matlab** This folder contains the Matlab code for generating synthetic datasets, creating QUBO and comparing to non-quantum state of the art. Examples of synthetic datasets can be found in the folder QuMoSeg_Data. For questions about this part, please contact Federica Arrigoni federica.arrigoni@polimi.it 
2) **QuMoSeg_Demo.py** This script contains the python code for running our quantum methods on D-Wave Advantage 4.1. For questions about this part, please contact Vladislav Golyanik golyanik@mpi-inf.mpg.de 
3) 

More details can be found in our paper and in the project page: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/QuMoSeg/
